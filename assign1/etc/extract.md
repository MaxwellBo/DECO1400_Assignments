# MAIN

You are relaxing one afternoon after school
when you get a phone call from your uncle
Bruce, a brilliant scientist and world traveler.

"I'm just in from Egypt," he says. "I have to get
some new equipment to continue my investigations of the Pyramids. How would you like to go back with me for a few weeks?"

You have always envied Bruce—dashing off to
exotic places in the Middle East and the Orient,
sometimes vanishing for months at a time. It
doesn't take you long to make up your mind to
go.

The next few days are a blur of preparations.
Before you know it, you and Bruce are on a TWA
jet heading for Rome on the first leg of the trip to
Cairo.

On the plane, your uncle explains his plan to
place special instruments in a chamber under the
center of the largest pyramid at Giza. He hopes to
test the pyramid's effect on the paths of cosmic
rays—rays made up of high-speed particles from
space that usually penetrate deep into the
ground.

"If my theory is correct," he says, "these rays
could be concentrated by the pyramid to produce
an unlimited amount of energy."

While Bruce is talking, you notice that a man
nearby is straining to hear him. No doubt he's just
curious. He is strange-looking, though!

In Rome you change to an Egyptair jet You are
startled to notice the same man from the other jet
aboard your Cairo-bound plane.

"I will have lots of red tape to take care of at the
airport when we land," says Bruce. "Why don't
you just breeze through customs and take a cab
to the Star and Crescent Hotel, where we're staying? My assistant, Andrea, will be waiting there
for you. She can get you settled in our room
while my equipment is unloaded from the plane."
As soon as you land, Bruce is off to the baggage area, leaving you alone in a foreign land. 

As
if that isn't enough, the stranger from the plane
appears and hands you a small, folded piece of
paper, then dashes toward the taxi stand outside
the terminal.

Quickly you unfold the note. Scrawled in red
ink are the words "Beware the Sphinx."

You have heard about the statue of the Sphinx
next to the Pyramids. But why should you beware of it? The thought occurs to you that
"sphinx" could be a code word and not refer to
the actual Sphinx at all. Maybe the note is a
meaningless hoax. On the other hand, it could
spell danger for you and Bruce.

You remember the time you felt an urge to get
off a bus in your hometown—just before it was hit
by a truck. Now you have a hunch that you
should follow this man.

# HOTEL

There's no telling what kind of trouble you
might get into if you just run off after this guy
without really knowing where you are going.

You toss your bag into the back of a cab.

"Star and Crescent Hotel," you tell the driver.
When you arrive, Andrea is waiting for you in
the lobby. She helps you check in.

The bellboy insists on carrying your bag, even
though you are traveling light. As you leave the
elevator and head for your room, you could
swear that the door, which was slightly ajar,
closed as you approached. Maybe it was the
wind, but the air seems very still. And after that
warning note at the airport, you don't want to
take any chances.

"Wait," you say. "I don't want this room. I
don't like the location."

The bellboy looks confused, and Andrea
seems shocked. You haven't had a chance to tell
her about the note.

"I'll explain later," you tell Andrea. "Right now
I'm going to go back down to the lobby and ask
for a different room."

But at the check-in desk, the clerk will not listen
to you. What will you do?

# FOLLOW

The strange man is already in a cab when you
reach the stand in front of the terminal. You manage to jump into the next cab in line.

"Do you speak English?" you ask.

"I speak much English, meestehr."

"Good, then follow that cab," you tell him.

Your cab weaves in and out of the heavy traffic,
with its horn blaring constantly. Your driver just
barely misses one car after another. However, he
does manage to keep less than a block behind the
other car.

The fast-moving traffic slows to a snail's pace
once you get into an older section of the city. The
cab you are following stops, and the strange man
gets out. You hand your driver a couple of American bills, hoping they cover your fare. Fortunately, the driver seems more than pleased as you
leave the cab.

You can barely see through the thick crowd,
but you do catch a glimpse of the man you are
following. He is entering what looks like a cafe.
You push your way over to the entrance.

The rhythmic beat of Middle Eastern music hits
your ears as you go inside. There is a heavy smell
of incense. A belly dancer sways in the center of
the dance floor. You find a table off in a dim
corner. You can't see the man you followed, but
your eyes are still adjusting to the darkness.

![Man keeled over table intoxicated][Choose_Your_Own_Adventure-037.png]


A waiter brings you a long-handled pot containing thick, strong coffee. He pours it ceremoniously into a small porcelain cup. It tastes
somewhat bitter, but not too bad. You sip it slowly
as you watch the dancing. Is it your imagination,
or does the dancer keep glancing in your direction?

The music grows louder. The lights get brighter.
You can't seem to focus your eyes. Your arms
and legs feel like lead, and you can't move them.
You feel dizzy. You feel like you are passing out!


You wake up to find yourself lying on an iron
cot in a small storeroom. You sit up and try to
move, and find that one ankle is chained to the
bed.

Gradually your eyes become accustomed to
the darkness. There is a small window high above
you on the wall, and through it you can see a
crescent moon shining. You can hear the beat of
the music you heard in the cafe. You sit there in
the half-darkness trying to figure out how to pick
the ancient-looking padlock that secures the
chain on your ankle.

The door to the room opens slightly, throwing
a shaft of light inside. It's bright enough for you to
recognize the dancer from the cafe. Quietly she
closes the door and whispers in your ear.


"My name is Serena. I will help you escape."

She inserts a long, thin bar into the padlock on
your ankle. The lock snaps open.

"Here, quickly!" she says. "Stand on my shoulders and climb out the window. It leads to a
rooftop. I will pull myself up and follow."

You want to go with her, but you have no idea
who this woman is and where she might be leading you. She could be getting you into a worse
situation. You look at the window high up on the
wall and then at the open door in front of you


[Decide to accept Serena's help](#ACCEPT)

[Try to escape through
the door, because you don't trust her](#ESCAPE)

# ESCAPE 

You pull open the door and dash down a corridor that leads back into the cafe. You run outside. Two men from the cafe race after you,
shouting in Arabic. You push your way through
the crowds, trying to stay hidden. Which way to
go? There is an open door on your right with a
small courtyard inside. You decide to chance it
and dart through the door, slamming it behind
you. You lean against the door, gasping for
breath.

A hulk of a man appears. He has a heavy, dark
beard and piercing eyes.

"Welcome to my house," he says. "Have you
come to buy a magic spell or perhaps something
to ward off the evil eye?"

"I need help," you say. "Someone is after me."

"In that case, you are welcome in my humble
house. You are safe here. I am Al-Din, the magician. My magic will protect you."

You follow Al-Din up a flight of stairs into a
room with a low table surrounded by cushions.
He serves you some mint tea and tells you about
the ancient magic he practices.

"All is illusion," he says. "Here, I will show you.
Close your eyes and repeat this spell three times:
abah arah arah abah blah ah."

You repeat Al-Din's spell three times. The room
begins to spin around you, then fades away altogether. You seem to be floating in a void. Are
you asleep? Dreaming? You find yourself flying
high up over the ocean on what could be a magic
carpet.

You awaken in your living room back home.
The phone is ringing. You answer it. Your uncle is
on the phone.

"I'm just in from Egypt," he says. "I have to get
some new equipment to continue my investigations of the Pyramids. How would you like to go
back with me for a few weeks?"

This is really strange. Did you just dream everything that happened, or did that magician really
send you back here to start over?

would still like to go](#MAIN)

# SELFDOUBT 

Maybe jet lag and your imagination are getting
the best of you.

"Never mind," you tell the desk clerk.

You go back up to the room and unpack your
small suitcase. You make a careful search. There
is no sign that an intruder has been there, and
you feel relieved. Your room turns out to be a
suite, with a bedroom, a sitting room, a small
bathroom, and two tiny closets. The bedroom
windows are covered with elaborately patterned
grillwork. Andrea's room is on the same floor,
down the hall.

Bruce finally arrives and you show him the
note. For a moment he looks alarmed. Then he
smiles. "Well, I suggest we forget about it for the
moment and go out on the town," he says. "I
know this great spot called the Sahara Club
where we can get a delicious meal of shish kebab—and even watch some genuine Egyptian
belly dancing."

When you arrive back at the hotel later, you are
very tired. Andrea goes to her room, Bruce retires
to the bedroom, and you quickly fall asleep on
the couch in the sitting room.

Toward early morning some inner instinct halfawakens you. You hear a faint rustling and the
sound of a door softly clicking shut. You snap on
the small table lamp. Only inches away from your
face is an asp, one of the deadliest snakes in the
world.

You've got seconds before it strikes.

down on the snake](#PILLOW)
