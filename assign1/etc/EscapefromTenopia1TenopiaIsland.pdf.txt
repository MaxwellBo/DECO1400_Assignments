NOTICE!!I
You are about to find yourself trapped on a strange and dangerous island on one of the most forbidding planets in the galaxy: Tenopia. lt's important that you follow the directions in this book if you hope to
es- cape!
During your travels on Tenopia lsland, you'll
have a small computer that can project a map of the region you're in at any moment. To use this, flip to the map page indicated near the bottom of the page you're reading. (When you turn to a map page, be sure to keep a finger on the page you're reading so you won't lose your place.)
Whether or not you escape from Tenopia Island will depend on how skillful you are, how persistent you are, and how lucky you are. Will you succeed-or will you be trapped Iorever? lt's entirely up to you!

While you are lraveling on a diplomatic mission from Earth to the Mylaean Cluster, your spaceship is hit by a meleor. With seconds lo spare, you jettison in an escape pod, the only survivor. The pod's buih-in computer indicates there is only enough fuel to reach Tenopia, the fifth planet of Star Sysiem Tenopia. The compuler's memory bank supplies you with ihe fol- lowing information:
TENOPIA: a/s Earlh size; rotation 26 hours; sun rises in the east, sets in wesl; revolution 587 days; air quality excellent; food and wa- ler abundant; surface 80% ocean with one large island (Tbnopia lsland) and a single continent (Kabran); ocean is subject to vio- lent storms; galaclic language widely spo- ken; technology generally medieval; travel dangerous and not advised.
Bracing yourself for entry into Tenopia's atmo- sphere, you examine your only survival equipment- a pocket-sized computer ihat is programmed
to project a map of your region at all times on a small video screen.
Suddenly, on the pod's computer, you
read:

Your tiny craft sets down with a sharp
jolt.
You lie dazedlor a few minutes before you can pullyourself together. By the time you crawl through the hatch, your pod is already surrounded by giani half-human creatures with huge forked hands. They blindfold you and lead you along a winding bumpy surface, then down a long ladder thai leads deep underground. At last they remove your blindfold. You are in a huge dimly lit cavern that reeks of sulfurous fumes. The creatures search you. You hold your
breath when they find your computer. But they toss it aside as a useless ornament, and you're able to relrieve it
a few moments later.
You quickly learn that your captors are crogocides and thdi you have been condemned to slavery in their krelium mine. Closely watched by crogocide guards wielding long spiked sticks, you are forced to chip and shovel krelium ore for seven hours before you're allowed to resi for the night.
Most of the slaves speak the galactic language, and during the days that follow you make friends with Prespar, an old hominid from a nearby planet. He looks almost as human as yourself.
When you ask whether there is any hope of escape from the mine, Prespar merely shakes his head. But that night, while lhere are no crogocides nearby, he comes to you and whispers, "There is a secret tunnel that leads lo the surface. Tomorrow I will show you the slab that hides the entrance."
"How do I get to the nearest galactic patrol
sta- tion?" you whisper back.

A few minutes later, three crogocides seize you. Blindfolded, hands tied behind your back, you're transported by cart and by boat and again by cart to i,l
the krelium mine. There you are sei to ihe
same grueling work-chipping and shoveling, chipping and shoveling.
This time you're watched more closely than ever by the crogocide guards. Several days pass before you have a chance to pull back the slab covering the secret tunnel.
Your heart is in your mouth because you're afraid you'll find the passageway sealed off. But it's still open! Soon you're standing once again on the sur- face of Tenopia! You're only at the beginning o{ your journey, but at leasi you know a lot more than before.

fu you walk along the road, the orange sunlight sireaming through yellow-lea{ed trees produces
a misty light like nothing you've ever seen. Afler several hours of travel, you hear weird, rhythmic music ahead-a chorus of voices running up and down the scale, changing from dissonance to harmony.
!f you have visited the red-winged bird people before, turn to page 8. If not, read on....
You are drawn to the sound, but before you
can reach its source, two bird people with dark red wings spring from behind a tree. The music stops, and in
a moment a dozen more bird people gather around you. They seem friendly, and you waste no time
in telling them of your quest for Zindor.
Their leader, Kumba, listens attentively. "You wish fo go to Zindor? I can only tell you this. lf you ever reach the village of lssus on the shore of Lake Shonra, you will see a signpost with ihree signs. Fol- low the sign that is most different from the other two."

Looking al your map, you nolice that Agron is due north. At lhe same time you remember that Prespar said that the prince of Agron could help you. There's no road leading north, but you can use the orange sun as
your compass, and the terrain is {airly flat and mostly unwooded. You have a good meal o{ berries and breadfruit gathered from planis along,the way and, with the midday sun at

The prince listens with interest as you recount the events that brought you to Tenopia and of your search for Zindor.'Ah, Zindor," he sighs. "Besides this for- tress, Zindor
is the only place on the island that is safe from the crogocides. lt lies nestled in the lava fields on the eastern slopes of the great Keona Volcano. Al- though the volcano has been dormant for many years, il rumbles and smokes from time lo time, and the crogocides are afraid to go near it."
"How would one reach the volcano?" you
ask. "Well,"
says the prince, scratching his furry chin, "the volcano lies far to the soulheast of here, beyond Cerzan. But if you go southeast, you risk being cap- tured by crogocides. lt would be safer to go northeast to Sita, and hope to find your way from there."

You travel through rolling meadows spotted with gigantic pine trees, their needles as big as baseball bats. You've trekked several miles when you hear a sound like a foghorn, rising in pitch to a piercing shriek. Looking up at the sky, you see a great blue bird, larger than any you have seen on Earth. lt's div- ing right at

Surrounded by a high stone wall, the great castle looks invulnerable to any force of arms that could be mustered on Tenopia lsland. A small furry-bodied guard dressed in a gray uniform and armed with
a sharp spear stops you at the gaie.
"Please, I am a stranger to this is[and.
I

say. After conferring with some oiher guards, he leads you inio the castle itself, through a broad courtyard and up winding stone stairs to the main gallery. There you sit and wait uniil you are so tired you nearly fall asleep.

say. You gratefully accept their offer to provide boat transportation to the prince's castle, near the extreme northwest part of the island.
On your arrival a few days later, the prince wel- comes you in a most kindly manner. After you're well fed and well rested, he sends you on your way with these words: " l have learned that to reach Zindor, you must find Chawakelamptha and then pass through Chiga, and then go south from there.

You're glad to be heading east, bui soon a cold gray fog rolls in from the sea. Shivering, you hurry on. A little way farther, you reach a fork in the road. Consulting your map, you decide that the right fork leads to Agron and the lefi fork continues east along the coast.

Hiking across the rolling meadows, you marvel al the tall golden grass tufted with seed pods that glow like embers in the soft orange sunlight. The
seeds themselves laste like bits of honey-a few dozen of them make a decenl meal. You're thankful that food is so abundant on Tenopia lsland.
From the top of a ridge, you see a lone zekee peacefully nibbling grass. Cautiously you approach and then, with a flash of daring, swing onto its back. Startled, the animal breaks into a gallop. You clutch its shaggy mane and hang on.
There's no chance of steering the animal; you'll just have to go where it goes. You close your
eyes and pray you'll survive. The zekee canlers over the countryside for almosi an hour before it rears up and sends you tumbling into the grass. Dazed, you look around and start walking.

Soon afler setting out, you enter the mosl depress- ing wilderness you can imagine. There is hardly any vegelation-the land is almosl a
desert-and yet there are broad strelches of soggy sand and pools of stag- nant waier. Suddenly you find no support under your feet. ln a few seconds you're up to your knees in quicksand. Trying to wade oul, you sink deeper still. You flop over on your back. With your weight now spread over your whole body, you float on the watery sand, and you're able
io paddle and roll your
way back onto firm ground.
Maybe you should turn back. You shudder at the prospect of being trapped in this wasteland, ex- hausted and with no chance of finding food. Yet if you lurn back, you may wander around the island forever. You try lo move fonruard, but once again your way is blocked by quicksand.

Much to your surprise, you have no further trouble along the way. You arrive safely at Carthage. a beauti- ful town with buildings made of marble slabs ar- ranged in cubes and rectangles. Looking south, you can see the smoky blue outline of the Karra Moun- tains.
lf you have been to Carthage before, go on to the next page. lf not, read on. . .
.
A family of bird people takes you in with them. They show you the vast quarries from which the mar- ble was removed. You learn thai most of the marble was taken out thousands of years ago and lies in cities long since buried by earthquakes.
Your new friends warn you that the way south is blocked by an impassable gorge; the only bridge re- cently collapsed in a storm. The trail to the northwest is too dangerous, but there are other trails, they say: one to the northeast that leads to the Land of No- where, and one to the north that leads to the Land of the Miniphants.

Through woods and meadows you walk, on and on. After a while the land begins rising steeply. Up, up, up you climb, to lhe summit of Mount Calm. The great orange sun breaks through the fast-moving clouds, giving you a view like none other you've seen on Tenopia lsland.
To the west, Mounl Friz, {ar too tall and steep to climb, towers above you. To the south you can see much of Lake Shonra. Far to the southeasl is a mag- nificent snow-capped
cone-the Keona Volcano. A curling plume of smoke rises from its summit. To the north is hilly, semiarid country as far as you can see. You think back over what you've learned so far in your travels, trying to decide which way to go. The land is very rugged; there are only two possible routes.

By noon, you reach a high mounlain ridge. After descending the steep slope on the far side, you arrive at lssus, a tiny village at the weslernmosl tip ol Lake Shonra. The bird people here offer you fried fish for lunch, but they will not answer your questions aboui Zindor. You wonder whether they are afraid you might be a crogocide spy.
Then one of the villagers beckons to you.
He points to a signpost with three signs, each with
an arrow. One arrow points straight ahead, one points to the left, and one points lo the right. The ihree signs look like this:

Before you can do anything, the crogocides grab you and shove you down a flight of stone steps into
a dimly lighted cellar. Croping your way along the walls, you find a passageway. You investigate it and quickly perceive that you
have entered a maze. You wander through the maze, hoping that somehow you'll find your way to freedom, but you only get more and more lost. You begin to panic, then stop, trying to get hold of yourself. You've got to think of
a strategy for getting out of the maze. Two ideas occur lo you.

You've decided to head upstream, away from the sea. You walk along the stream for a while. Then, coming upon a road, you follow it west, ready to hide at the firsi sign of crogocides.
Shortly after crossing the ruins of an ancient wall, you see a far different landscape ahead. You've en- tered an area oI steaming wastes. The air smells of sulfur. The spongy ground gurgles under your feet.
You make your way past boiling geysers. Ahead of you, mists of foul-smelling vapors rise from a crevice spanned by a narrow, sagging wooden bridge. You step back a bit to fill your lungs with air, then cau- tiously step onto the bridge, praying it won't collapse.

Shar seems pleasant enough, and you decide to stay a few days to rest and think about where to go next. You spend a day working on a fishing boat and become friendly with a blrd person named Krug.

You're able to find a trail that winds lhrough lhe Karra Mountains, and after two days of lravel you come upon a beautiful valley.

soon as you pry one off, two more coil about you. You yell, but no one is there to hear you. Yet the moment you cry out, the snakes drop back to the grass. They raise their heads several feet in the air and look al you curiously. You breathe a sigh of relief, wipe your
brouv, and con- tinue on your way, some of the snakes still following like friendly puppies.

Rounding a bend, you see an animal ahead-a giant spider several feet high! Three spikes project from its great head. Suddenly it pounces on a small. mampal, tosses it with its front legs, then tears it apart.
Shuddering, you pick up a heavy stick from the forest floor. Little use! Ahead of you
is a whole army of giant spiders. You turn around, but there are more of them on the route you just traveledl You stumble into the forest, trying to follow a straight line and hoping you'll reach a safe trail.

Kin Rugg smiles broadly as the balloon drifts along.
"What about the great storms that sink ships-can we avoid them?" you
ask. "The storms occur close to the surface. We shall fly above them," Kin Rugg replies. But then he adds, "h's irue we'll need a bit of luck."
Soon the island is
just
ahazy speck on the horizon' You're not home yet, but you don'i have any doubt you're going to make it. You've shown you have what it takes, and you're ready for whatever adventures await you on the planet TenoPia.
The End
l0r
ln time, you reach the village of Verde. The people here cast furtive glances at
you, then slink away when you move toward them. Even if anyone would talk to you, you'd hesitate to ask for help. You feel you can't trust anyone in this village.
But then an old woman walks right up to you. She seems to have come from another planet,
as
you did. Her face has a triangular shape that you can'i associ- ate with other hominids you've seen on Tenopia ls- land. "You look as if you need help," she says.
When you tell her your story she nods wisely. "Be- tween here and Zindor lie the Dazzling Mountains," she says. "You can go around them, to the east or to the west."
"Which is best?" you demand. ln a singsong voice, she replies, "East is least and west is best if reason must rhyme."

fu you travel on in search of a route to Zindor, you have to follow winding animal trails through chest- high vegetation. The lush landscape is punctuated by tall, skinny trees with enormous umbrellalike leaves. Birds with siriking gold and silver plumage hover overhead, occasionally diving into the brush to cap- ture small prey.
When at last you reach a high ridge you find your- self looking down on a beautiful harbor. A sailing ves- sel is lying at anchor not far offshore. At the edge of lhe water is an encampment. And only a few dozen yards away from you is a group of hominids. They are not crogocides, but they are armed with spears and slings. You're not sure what military group this is, bul you know that once you enter their preserve, your fate will be in their hands.

After agreeing with Frias about ihe beauty of Cha- wakelamptha, you ask his advice on how to proceed. "There are many trails down the mountain, and they lead many ways," he replies. "Maps are of little help here, so listen carefully. When you
leave tomor- row, fake the trail that starts from the great rock spire to the north of here. By dusk you will reach a cave shared by four monks, who will give you food and shelter.
"Farther down, the trail divides into three separate trails. To reach Zindor you must pass through Chiga. Each monk knows the way. But only one willtell the truth.The other three will always lie, because they will not want you to travel over sacred ground. lt's up to you to figure out which monk is telling the truth."
Thanking Frias for his,help, you turn in for the night.

Once again you have reached the monastery of Chawakelamptha.
The abbot, Frias, greets you with a smile. "Per- haps you did not believe the right monk," he says. "Well,
next time remember that only one ol them ever lells the truth, so you can be sure that if any two monks agree about anything, then those two musl be lying."

You unhitch the boat from the dock, raise the sail, and head toward the east end of the lake. But you're soon forced off course by strong winds. The boat has a strange rig, and you can't seem to manage it. Soon you're being blown out toward the center of the lake and far to the west.
The waves grow higher. Spray comes over the side. You forget about trying to get anywhere-you just want to make it safely to shore. To make matters worse, a dense fog is sweeping across the lake. "Why did I do this?" you shout.
The boat is hard to sail, but it's solid and sound, and when the wind subsides, you are still afloat. You drift through the night and finally reach a deserted shore just be{ore dawn.

Ill Over the wall you jump. fu your feer hir rhe ground, you sense that you've made lhe wrong move. Peering through the brush is another human, but he scampers into the woods like a frightened ani- mal.
You pass some old bird people sitting in a circle, chewing on roots. Nearby, a giant sloth is standing on its hind legs, gnawing at the bark of a tree. Continu- ing on, you see other creatures. They all seem to be living in a world of their own-as if they have been there a very long time.
You walk on through land covered with beautiful mosses and ferns but barren of trees. Soon afterward you reach the top of a 3O0-foot-high cliff. From it you gaze down at the huge waves breaking against the rocks below. Walking along first in one direction, then in the other, you find that the wall from which you jumped seals off a narrow peninsula entirely bound by high cliffs. Slowly it dawns on you:
this must be Cape Mori. Only now do you remember Prespar's warning. You've jumped into a trap-a prison from which you may never escape.
Go on to the next page.

The weather is mild, and you build a lean-to that gives you a comfortable shelter for sleeping. Deli- cious breadfruit, berries, and nuts grow everywhere, so you have no lear of starving to death. But neither do you have any hope of being rescued. And as the days go by, you grow increasingly depressed.
One day, as you are walking through a meadow, you trip on a rock and fall on your face, almost bang- ing your head on another rock. The whole meadow is strewn with rocks, many of them small enough to carry. You realize you can build a staircase to the top of the wall!
You pick up a rock and carry it to the wall. Then you go back and get another. You lay them side by side. You go back and get another rock, then another, and anotheri and another. You work all the rest of that day and most of the next and the next and the next. At last your staircase is built. Joyfully you climb to the top and descend the buttress on the other side. You are \ree of your prison, but you still have a long way to go to escape from Tenopia lsland. There's nothing to do now but start walking.

Sita looks just the way you remember it,
except there is no boat being readied to leave port. Hoping to learn something by dreaming, you pick an
un- occupied straw mat and lie down. Once again sleep comes, quickly bringing a dream about the friendly, blue bird people. In your dream, the bird people in- terrupt their lively chatter to listen attentively to your questions. But before you can hear any answers,
a new dream is upon
you-a
vision of a great volcano, smoke rising from its snow-capped cone. As if you were flying near it, you look down and see the porous black lava fields at the base of the mountain. Nestled in a valley spared by the lava flow is a tiny village. A large balloon rises from the village and drifts slowly toward the distant sea. As quickly as it began, this dream is replaced by another: you are back in the village of Sita. The bird people are standing nearby, chattering excitedly. One of them screams. You look around. Dozens of crogocides, holding nets and spears, are charging toward you. Suddenly you wake up in a cold sweat! The scene around you
is as quiet and peaceful as ever. But you have no doubt you should get out of town in a hurry. You quickly rise from your mat and head east at a brisk pace.
Turn to page 82.

For hours you travel through swampy, squishy land spotted with dead trees and sinkholes, from which smoke and steam pour forth. You dazedly make your way over the difficult terrain, choking on the fumes. Suddenly you slip, twisting your ankle, and fall into
a pit. You lie for a moment at the bottom of the steam- ing pit, rubbing your throbbing ankle, then franiically search the sides of the pit for a handhold. Noth- ing. You raise your eyes-and see a triangular- headed creature staring at you from the lip of the pit. You shrink back, but then you remember something you heard on your iravels. This must be a volca! These intelligent and friendly creaiures live solely on ammenia. Their habitat is limited to a few places where no other creature would survive.
Another volca quickly joins the first. Swinging their power{ul tails down into the pit, they swiftly pull you up to the surface. They carry you to ihe edge of their habitat, where grass and trees begin to grow, and you rest there while your ankle is mending.
ln a few days, your ankle feels fine, and thanks to the volcas, you're able to move on. The ammonia fumes. are too strong for you io go north, and the route south is blocked by cliffs and canyons.

Deciding thal you must hold on to your computer at all costs, you decllne the guard's offer and resign yourself to an indefinite sentence at hard labor. Some- day, you vow, you'll find a chance io
escape. ln the days ahead, security becomes tighter than ever. Cuards watch you day and night. When you have a chance to talk to some of the other prisoners, ones who have been there a long time, they all say the same thing: there is no hope.
You won't give up hope-that's all you have left. Yet, as the days pass, you find yourself becoming in- creasingly depressed. Then one day you are awak- ened much earlier than usual and brought before one of the crogocide overseers. "We
have more workers here than we need and not enough in the krelium mine," he tells you. "Tomorrow you will be trans- ferred, and it is in the krelium mine, not here, where you will spend the rest of your life."
This is hardly good news; yet it's enough to
re- kindle your spirits. And you still have

fu you head west, you soon Iind yourself climbing along a narrow ridge, which falls off steeply on either side inlo impassable lava fields. You realize you must be nearing the base of the Keona Volcano. Stopping on the narrow ridge you raise your eyes skyward. A heavy plume of smoke is rising from the volcano's summit, and you don't relish the thought of
ap- proaching more closely.
You step forward slowly-and almost stumble over a crogocide lying in the grass. He seems to
have fallen asleep while guarding ihe trail. What is there to guard? you wonder. Your heart leaps wilh antici- pation. You tiptoe past the guard and continue on. Ahead, the ridge curves. Walking quickly you reach the curve and look down onto a beautiful valley nearly surrounded by mounds of solidified lava. ln ihe center of lhe valley is a cluster of neatly crafted houses.
fu you walk into the tiny settlement, a hominid of the same species as Prespar comes forward to meet you. "My
name is Kin Rugg. Welcome to Zindor," he says.

From your pocket you pull a crumpled and barely legible letter. "Prespar sent me to ride in his place on the balloon trip to Kabran," you explain. Kin Rugg reads the letter and nods.

fu you wait out the storm, huddled with the moun- tain people for warmth, one of them pulls a familiar- looking object from his sack. You let out a cry of surprise. lt's your computer!

open this. Poof! Ow! Ow! Ow!" As he speaks, the mountain person imitates a crogocide trying to open some- thing, jumping
back as i{ from an explosion, and throwing the thing down. The guard who took your compuier must have tried to open it and gotten an electric shock!
You amuse the mountain people by sliowing them how you can project a map of the region. Fortunately they know the land so well, they have no interest in keeping the computer for themselves.
The storm subsides, and the mountain people guide you to a trail they promise will lead to a
safe place.
